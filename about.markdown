Hi, I'm 0lli -- welcome to Nulli.

This is my corner of the internet where I share thoughts on code, design, and intentional living. I'm drawn to minimalism -- not as an aesthetic, but as a way of thinking. Fewer distractions, clearer purpose, better work.

### What you'll find here

- Reflections on writing clean, maintainable code
- Ideas about simplicity in design and daily life
- Occasional deep dives into tools and workflows I find useful

### A bit about me

I'm a developer who believes that the best software (and the best decisions) come from restraint and clarity. I build things with care, and I write here to think out loud.

If you'd like to connect, you can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/fiebaa).
